Leo’s Roofing has worked on several projects for me in Summit County, from heat tape installation to full roof replacements. They’re reliable, professional, and show up on time—no small feat in the mountains. Their team understands the challenges of high-altitude roofing and consistently delivers quality work. Whether it's metal roofing or standard shingles, they get it done right. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Leo and his crew for any roofing or exterior project in the area. - Armani Zangari, Summit Resort Group

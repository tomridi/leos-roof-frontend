I’ve worked with Leo’s Roofing and Remodeling in Summit County on multiple projects, and they consistently exceed expectations. Their team is responsive, professional, and always punctual—qualities that are invaluable in the often unpredictable mountain construction environment.​
Leo’s has handled everything from heat tape inspections and installations to full roof replacements and ongoing maintenance for me. Their versatility is impressive—they’re equally skilled with standard asphalt shingles and more complex systems like standing seam metal roofs, which are ideal for our alpine climate.​
What sets them apart is their deep understanding of the unique challenges that come with roofing in high-altitude, snow-heavy regions. Whether it’s ensuring proper drainage, preventing ice dams, or selecting materials that can withstand extreme weather, Leo’s Roofing brings both technical expertise and local insight to every job.​
They’ve completed full roof replacements and remodels throughout Summit County, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them for any roofing or exterior remodeling project in the mountains. Their reliability and craftsmanship make them a standout choice.
